#!The areas of "mispronunciation detection" (or "accent detection" more specifically) within the speech recognition community are receiving increased attention now. Two application areas, namely language learning and speech recognition adaptation, are largely driving this research interest and are the focal points of this work. There are a number of Computer Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems with Computer Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT) techniques that have been developed. In this thesis, a new HMM-based text-dependent mispronunciation system is introduced using text Adaptive Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (AFCCs). It is shown that this system outperforms the conventional HMM method based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). In addition, a mispronunciation detection and classification algorithm based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is introduced to help language learners identify and correct their pronunciation errors at the word and syllable levels. To improve speech recognition by adaptation, two projects have been explored. The first one improves name recognition by learning acceptable variations in name pronunciations, as one of the approaches to make grammar-based name recognition adaptive. The second project is accent detection by examining the shifting of fundamental vowels in accented speech. This approach uses both acoustic and phonetic information to detect accents and is shown to be beneficial with accented English. These applications can be integrated into an automated international calling system, to improve recognition of callers' names and speech. It determines the callers' accent based in a short period of speech. Once the type of accents is detected, it switches from the standard speech recognition engine to an accent-adaptive one for better recognition results.

#!As a more efficient means of supplying computing resources in the form of a utility, cloud computing platforms have been increasingly used to meet the insatiable demand from mobile applications. With virtualization and statistical multiplexing, cloud computing platforms are able to provide a much higher level of efficiency when it comes to utilizing computing resources, such as CPU cycles and network bandwidth. The research problems we study in this thesis are in the general research area of mobile cloud computing , as we seek to design and implement new algorithms and protocols that straddle the boundary between mobile applications and cloud computing systems, so that their performance can be jointly optimized to provide the best possible user experience, yet operating within the constraints of available resources and operational costs. We consider mobile applications and cloud computing as two sides of the same “coin,” and this thesis takes both sides into consideration. From the perspective of mobile applications, we show that interactive applications have the need to stream multi-touch gestures among multiple users, and these streams are broadcast sessions in nature, and are delay-sensitive, bursty, with low bit rates in general. Tailored to the nature of multi-touch gesture streams, we propose a new protocol that uses inter-session network coding to reduce the gesture recognizing delays. Towards supporting mobile applications using the cloud infrastructure and its resources, we believe that mobile applications can benefit from a multi-party video conferencing service based on inter-datacenter networks in the cloud.We apply intra-session network coding to design a new inter-datacenter protocol to maximize the total throughput of all conferencing sessions in the cloud, subject to a latency constraint imposed by the nature of video conferencing. Our real-world experiments have shown that, the abundant available bandwidth in inter-datacenter networks helps to achieve substantially improved throughput, with very similar delays compared to traditional peer-to-peer solutions. From the perspective of cloud service providers, we study the challenges involved when resource utilization is to be maximized in the datacenters, and when operational costs are to be minimized. To maximize resource utilization, we propose a virtual machine (VM) migration algorithm based on Nash bargaining solutions. To minimize operational costs, we present optimal routing and flow assignment algorithms that route traffic across an inter-datacenter network, with and without store-and-forward capabilities in intermediate datacenters. With efficient and cost-effective utilization of resources in the cloud, and by designing new protocols that are applicable to both mobile applications and cloud computing systems, achieving an optimized level of user experience in a large number of interactive mobile application sessions will become a reality.

#cEnabling more accurate and efficient structured prediction
#index5390c04520f70186a0f55bfc
#!Machine learning practitioners often face a fundamental trade-off between expressiveness and computation time: on average, more accurate, expressive models tend to be more computationally intensive both at training and test time. While this trade-off is always applicable, it is acutely present in the setting of structured prediction, where the joint prediction of multiple output variables often creates two primary, inter-related bottlenecks: inference and feature computation time. In this thesis, we address this trade-off at test-time by presenting frameworks that enable more accurate and efficient structured prediction by addressing each of the bottlenecks specifically. First, we develop a framework based on a cascade of models, where the goal is to control test-time complexity even as features are added that increase inference time (even exponentially). We call this framework Structured Prediction Cascades (SPC); we develop SPC in the context of exact inference and then extend the framework to handle the approximate case. Next, we develop a framework for the setting where the feature computation is explicitly the bottleneck, in which we learn to selectively evaluate features within an instance of the mode. This second framework is referred to as Dynamic Structured Model Selection (DMS), and is once again developed for a simpler, restricted model before being extended to handle a much more complex setting. For both cases, we evaluate our methods on several benchmark datasets, and we find that it is possible to dramatically improve the efficiency and accuracy of structured prediction.

#!Le réseau de distribution et de transport de l'électricité se modernise dans plusieurs pays dont le Canada. La nouvelle génération de ce réseau que l'on appelle smart grid, permet entre autre l'automatisation de la production, de la distribution et de la gestion de la charge chez les clients. D'un autre côté, des appareils domestiques intelligents munis d'une interface de communication pour des applications du smart grid commencent à apparaître sur le marché. Ces appareils intelligents pourraient créer une communauté virtuelle pour optimiser leurs consommations d'une façon distribuée. La gestion distribuée de ces charges intelligentes nécessite la communication entre un grand nombre d'équipements électriques. Ceci représente un défi important à relever surtout si on ne veut pas augmenter le coût de l'infrastructure et de la maintenance.Lors de cette thèse deux systèmes distincts ont été conçus : un système de communication peer-to-peer, appelé Ring-Tree, permettant la communication entre un nombre important de noeuds (jusqu'à de l'ordre de grandeur du million) tel que des appareils électriques communicants et une technique distribuée de gestion de la charge sur le réseau électrique.Le système de communication Ring-Tree inclut une nouvelle topologie réseau qui n'a jamais été définie ou exploitée auparavant. Il inclut également des algorithmes pour la création, l'exploitation et la maintenance de ce réseau. Il est suffisamment simple pour être mis en oeuvre sur des contrôleurs associés aux dispositifs tels que des chauffe-eaux, chauffage à accumulation, bornes de recharges électriques, etc. Il n'utilise pas un serveur centralisé (ou très peu, seulement lorsqu'un noeud veut rejoindre le réseau). Il offre une solution distribuée qui peut être mise en oeuvre sans déploiement d'une infrastructure autre que les contrôleurs sur les dispositifs visés. Finalement, un temps de réponse de quelques secondes pour atteindre 1'ensemble du réseau peut être obtenu, ce qui est suffisant pour les besoins des applications visées. Les protocoles de communication s'appuient sur un protocole de transport qui peut être un de ceux utilisés sur l'Internet comme TCP ou UDP. Pour valider le fonctionnement de de la technique de contrôle distribuée et le système de communiction Ring-Tree, un simulateur a été développé; un modèle de chauffe-eau, comme exemple de charge, a été intégré au simulateur. La simulation d'une communauté de chauffe-eaux intelligents a montré que la technique de gestion de la charge combinée avec du stockage d'énergie sous forme thermique permet d'obtenir, sans affecter le confort de l'utilisateur, des profils de consommation variés dont un profil de consommation uniforme qui représente un facteur de charge de 100%.Mots-clés : Algorithme Distribué, Demand Response, Gestion de la Charge Électrique, M2M (Machine-to-Machine), P2P (Peer-to-Peer), Réseau Électrique Intelligent, Ring-Tree, Smart Grid

#*Wireless network physical layer security with smart antenna

#cWireless network physical layer security with smart antenna
#index5390c04520f70186a0f55bfa
#!Smart antenna technique has emerged as one of the leading technologies for enhancing the quality of service in wireless networks. Because of its ability to concentrate transmit power in desired directions, it has been widely adopted by academia and industry to achieve better coverage, improved capacity and spectrum efficiency of wireless communication systems. In spite of its popularity in applications of performance enhancement, the smart antenna’s capability of improving wireless network security is relatively less explored. This dissertation focuses on exploiting the smart antenna technology to develop physical layer solutions to anti-eavesdropping and location security problems. We first investigate the problem of enhancing wireless communication privacy. A novel scheme named “artificial fading” is proposed, which leverages the beam switching capability of smart antennas to prevent eavesdropping attacks. We introduce the optimization strategy to design a pair of switched beam patterns that both have high directional gain to the intended receiver. Meanwhile, in all the other directions, the overlap between these two patterns is minimized. The transmitter switches between the two patterns at a high frequency. In this way, the signal to unintended directions experiences severe fading and the eavesdropper cannot decode it. We use simulation experiments to show that the artificial fading outperforms single pattern beamforming in reducing the unnecessary coverage area of the wireless transmitter. We then study the impact of beamforming technique on wireless localization systems from the perspectives of both location privacy protection and location spoofing attack. For the location privacy preservation scheme, we assume that the adversary uses received signal strength (RSS) based localization systems to localize network users in Wireless LAN (WLAN). The purpose of the scheme is to make the adversary unable to uniquely localize the user when possible, and otherwise, maximize error of the adversary’s localization results. To this end, we design a two-step scheme to optimize the beamforming pattern of the wireless user’s smart antenna. First, the user moves around to estimate the locations of surrounding access points (APs). Then based on the locations of the APs, pattern synthesis is optimized to minimize the number of APs in the coverage area and degenerate the localization precision. Simulation results show that our scheme can significantly lower the chance of being localized by adversaries and also degrade the location estimation precision to as low as the coverage range of the AP that the wireless user is connected to. As personal privacy preservation and security assurance at the systemlevel are always conflictive to some extent, the capability of smart antenna to intentionally bias the RSS measurements of the localization system also potentially enables location spoofing attacks. From this aspect, we present theoretical analysis on the feasibility of beamforming-based perfect location spoofing (PLS) attacks, where the attacker spoofs to a target fake location by carefully choosing the beamforming pattern to fool the location system. The PLS problem is formulated as a nonlinear feasibility problem, and due to its intractable nature, we solve it using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) in conjunction with a heuristic local search algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our analytical approach and indicate the correlation between the geometry of anchor deployment and the feasibility of PLS attacks. Based on the simulation results, guidelines for guard against PLS attacks are provided.

#!This paper addresses international e-Customs standardization from the perspective of a global dairy company who faces the result of the standardization efforts. International trade stands in front of a paradox of increasing security and control in order to meet threats from terrorist, diseases and other risks while at the same time lower the administrative burden for traders in order to stay competitive. To solve this seemingly impossible equation national customs and regional economic organizations are seeking to establish a standardized solution for digital reporting of customs data. However, standardization has proven hard to achieve in the socio-technical e-Customs solution. The author identifies and describes what has to be harmonized in order for a global company should perceive e-Customs as standardized. In doing so the author contributes towards an improved understanding of the challenges associated with using a standardization mechanism for harmonizing socio-technical information systems.

#index5390c04520f70186a0f55bf8
#!The thesis investigates how Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) and Queueing Theory (QT) techniques help manage mass gathering (MG) crowds. The techniques are applied to Hajj MG, which is one of the most complex annual MG, with a focus on its challenging Tawaf ritual. The objective is to develop a Tawaf Decision Support System (DSS) to better understand Tawaf crowd dynamics and discover decisions that lead to superior performance. TawafSIM is an ABMS model in the DSS, which simulates macro-level Tawaf crowd dynamics through micro-level pilgrim modeling to explore the impact of crowd characteristics, facility layout, and management preferences on emergent crowd behaviours with respect to throughput, satisfaction, health, and safety. Whereas, TawafQT is a QT model in the DSS to explore the impact of pilgrim arrival rate and Tawaf throughput on expected arrival, departure, and waiting times along with average queue length in the Tawaf waiting area. The thesis provides several contributions, including the following. First, it is the only Tawaf research to use a hybrid ABMS and QT approach. Second, TawafSIM is a comprehensive Tawaf simulator. It incorporates features for pilgrim characteristics, facility design, and management preferences. It calculates eight metrics for Tawaf performance, which includes one for throughput, three for satisfaction, one for health, and three for safety. It is the only Tawaf simulator to estimate satisfaction and spread of infectious disease. It conducts 42 simulation experiments in 12 categories. It generates observations for emergent, tipping point, expected, and counter intuitive behaviours. It recommends a default scenario as the best decision along with a small subset of alternative scenarios, which provide above average Tawaf performance. It generates a Tawaf Crowd Management Guide to better understand Tawaf crowd dynamics and how to pursue above average Tawaf performance under different conditions. Third, TawafQT is the only study of the Tawaf waiting area. It uses an accurate queueing model with finite source, single service, and PH type distribution, which is not only applicable to the Tawaf and other Hajj related queueing systems but also to any queueing system, which has finite population and single service characteristics.

#!Internet access has become a necessity for all sectors in communities. Conventional web navigation means hinder access to the visually impaired. Presented is a low cost tactile web navigator device aimed at enabling blind people to have efficient and economic internet accessibility. Presented in this paper centers around a microcontroller that communicates with a proxy transcoder browser server that runs on a PC to acquire the text from a target web page. An array of solenoid coils is used to output the text in tactile form to the end user. The device has the ability to output the text in Braille language format mode or in plain English character format using the usual dot-matrix representations mode. The navigator can also be configured to output the text in other languages using the Pattern-Generator tool Many navigation functions like loading a webpage address, clicking on links and entering data E-mails, passwords, etc have been provided. The navigator was tested by blind volunteer with excellent results. The cost of the implementation is an impressive ~12% of the price of commercial Braille displays.

#!Interactive processes are omnipresent in fields dealing with automation of complex technical processes, allowing a wide range of application scenarios of assistance systems to support human operators. However, the definition and description of the interaction strongly depends on the application. The description of Human-Process-Interaction HPI in most cases is the key for the development of interaction models leading to a framework for the development of assistance systems. The goal of such assistance systems is to support human operators, or human factors, and thereby improve the considered process in parallel. For the purpose of creating a framework for the development of assistance systems, the Situation-Operator-Model SOM approach is applied. The SOM approach is capable of modeling HPI in a net-like structure representing the complex environment or process and human interactions. By this formal modeling of HPI for the development of human-centered assistance systems based on the underlying modeled interaction is available. In this contribution illustrative examples of different applications for the proposed approach are given by a cognitive, individualized driver assistance system for lane changing maneuvers, by the assessment of operator decisions in air traffic control as well as the operator supervision in semi-automated production process.

#cAdaptive sensing strategies for opportunistic spectrum access
#index5390c04520f70186a0f55bf7
#!To meet the ever increasing spectrum demand, developing a mechanism for dynamic spectrum access seems inevitable. Spectrum sensing enables cognitive radios (CRs) to identify and use frequency bands (channels) that are not being used by primary users (PUs) at a particular place and time. However, sensing errors and limited sensing resources, such as sensing hardware and sensing time, introduce significant technical challenges to the development of such an ideal capability. Adaptive sensing strategies allow the sensing resources to be spent on more promising primary channels. This is achieved by exploiting past sensing outcomes of one secondary user (SU), or, as proposed in this research, multiple spatially distributed SUs. We propose adaptive sensing strategies for three different scenarios. First, we assume that a SU sequentially senses a number of primary channels to find the first available channel. We propose a two-stage spectrum detection strategy that allows the spectrum detector to quickly detect and skip though most of busy channels and spend most of its time on channels that are more likely to be idle. Second, we consider the case where multiple SUs jointly try to locate idle channels within a given sensing time, which itself is divided into a number of sensing slots. We propose a cooperative spectrum search strategy that specifies the channel to be sensed by each SU in each slot in such a way to maximize the expected number of identified idle channels. Third, we consider a primary network that operates in a synchronous time-framed fashion. We assume that the occupancy state of each primary channel over different time frames follows a discrete-time Markov process. We propose a cooperative sensing strategy that decides which channel should be sensed by which SU in each frame. The goal is to maximize a utility function that accounts for both the number of detected idle channel-frames and the number of miss-detected busy channel-frames. We present analytical and numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing strategies in increasing identified time-frequency spectrum opportunities and/or reducing interference with licensed systems.

Therefore, a data model is proposed which allows storing values of arbitrary types, including inter-data dependencies and meta information. Furthermore, an Extensible Markup Language XML based model to describe data formats is provided which allows specifying programs to convert data represented in existing formats both from and to the proposed data model. It will be shown that these programs are Turing complete, thus allowing the same arbitrarily complex conversions which are possible with Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations XSLT or the C programming language. Finally, the components of a prototypical Web based implementation in form of a validator, a data converter and a data generator are described. In combination with a data editor, parts of this prototypical implementation are already employed in several use cases in the industry and other research projects to transform data between different formats.

#!Presented is an architecture for event processing applications that manage business processes, and the authors use a case study of monitoring cardiac patient wait times to evaluate their architecture and illustrate our approach. Event processing applications can collect streams of events from sensors for processing to infer critical medical events in real time. However, to manage business processes, it is critical to understand not only where in the hospital those events occur, but also where in the business process those events are occurring. Metrics, such as wait times, can be computed in real-time by using complex event processing to integrate and aggregate events in support of fine grained monitoring of business processes. The authors evaluate their architecture against both current practice and related works in the literature.

#!Presented is a mobile-health m-health system architecture utilizing Bluetooth and web technologies for remote health data acquisition and monitoring. The proposed system aims at improving chronic disease management and diabetes in particular using a combination of existing patients' medical sensors, PDAs and PDAs-related Bluetooth technology. This offers a relatively low-cost solution compared to equivalent customized health data acquisition systems. At the patient end, the health data is acquired serially from the medical sensors and sent to the mobile devices using Bluetooth connectivity. The acquired data are then transmitted to a remote health hub using core IP network. Design and implementation of the Wireless Data Acquisition Module WDAM, wireless connectivity protocols, and architecture of the remote health hub applications are presented in this paper. The distributed nature of the proposed system allows for continuous acquisition and monitoring of patients' data anytime, anywhere and by anyone with modest technological background. Likewise, the patient's health providers can continuously monitor the acquired data of their patients for better disease management. Performance of the developed data acquisition system is assessed experimentally and seamless data acquisition and monitoring have been demonstrated.

#!Protein-protein interactions play various essential roles in cellular systems. Many methods have been developed for inference of protein-protein interactions from protein sequence data. In this paper, the authors focus on methods based on domain-domain interactions, where a domain is defined as a region within a protein that either performs a specific function or constitutes a stable structural unit. In these methods, the probabilities of domain-domain interactions are inferred from known protein-protein interaction data and protein domain data, and then prediction of interactions is performed based on these probabilities and contents of domains of given proteins. This paper overviews several fundamental methods, which include association method, expectation maximization-based method, support vector machine-based method, linear programming-based method, and conditional random field-based method. This paper also reviews a simple evolutionary model of protein domains, which yields a scale-free distribution of protein domains. By combining with a domain-based protein interaction model, a scale-free distribution of protein-protein interaction networks is also derived.

An intensive analysis of the application requirements simplified the process of modelling the application's behavioural model; therefore, instead of modelling several variation models, the developers modelled an extra-functionality model. COCA-MDA reduces the development effort because it maintains a clear separation of concerns and employs a decomposition mechanism to produce a context-oriented component model which decouples the applications' core functionality from the context-dependent functionality. Estimating the MDA approach's productivity can help the software developers select the best MDA-based methodology from the available solutions. Thus, counting the source line of code is not adequate for evaluating the development effort of the MDA-based methodology. Quantifying the maintenance adjustment factor of the new, adapted, and reused code is a better estimate of the development effort of the MDA approaches.

#*Standardization as Governance Without Government: A Critical Reassessment of the Digital Video Broadcasting Project's Success Story
#@Niclas Meyer

#!Industry-led technical standardization is often cited as an example for governance without government and the Digital Video Broadcasting DVB Project is often presented as a particularly successful case of such private governance. Succeeding the spectacular failure of the government-led high-definition television standardization project in European, the successes of the industry-led DVB Project have often been cited as evidence for the superior governance capacity of private industry. While the commercial and engineering success of the DVB Project is unequivocal, this paper raises the question whether it has been equally successful from a governance point of view.

#!The current efforts across industry and academia are to develop new paradigms that enable ubiquitous on-demand service provision. This aim may be achievable because of the envisaged deployment of cutting-edge technologies such as cooperative transmission. However, a real advancement is only attainable when autonomic system design principles are taken into account. Looking at the concept of the Relay Enhanced Cell, one may come across commonalities with Mobile Ad-hoc Networks. Especially in Local Area scenarios, Base Stations seem to resemble advanced Access Points, while fixed and movable Relay Nodes might be replaced by powerful mobile User Terminals. On top of it, Generic Autonomic Network Architecture would help accommodate the fact that network devices may expose autonomic cooperative behaviors, allowing them to play certain roles. Finally, such a network must interact with Operations Support System deployed by the network operator for uninterrupted, continued operation.

#!The implementation of cooperative diversity with relays has advantages over point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output MIMO systems, in particular, overcoming correlated paths due to small inter-element spacing. A simple transmitter with one antenna may exploit cooperative diversity or space time coding gain through distributed relays. In this paper, similar distributed transmission is considered with the golden code, and the authors propose a new strategy for relay selection, called the maximum-mean selection policy, for distributed transmission with the full maximum-likelihood ML decoding and sphere decoding SD based on a wireless relay network. This strategy performs a channel strength tradeoff at every relay node to select the best two relays for transmission. It improves on the established one-sided selection strategy of maximum-minimum policy. Simulation results comparing the bit error rate BER based on different detectors and a scheme without relay selection, with the maximum-minimum and maximum-mean selection schemes confirm the performance advantage of relay selection. The proposed strategy yields the best performance of the three methods.

#!Korea and China are among the rising challengers in the international ICT Information Communication and Technology standards regime. They are attempting to internationalize their home-grown technologies. As latecomers they share similarities and display differences. This paper examines two Korean cases WIPI and WiBro, and compares with Chinese cases. Thereby it helps to conceptualize and evaluate latecomers' strategies for international standardization. Comparison of the two countries' strategies for international standardization is useful and timely particularly considering forthcoming FTA negotiations between the two countries where TBT technical barriers to trade including standards becomes a critical part of the agreement. The cases of the two countries share some commonalities in terms of origination local R&D, government leadership and motivation reduction of royalties. The main difference is that while Korea is oriented towards the outside, China is towards the inside, at least by now. Due to its huge domestic markets and global influence, China's standards form a real threat to the incumbent standards from traditional players like US and EU.

#!An understanding of knowledge artifacts such as patterns is a necessary prerequisite for any subsequent action. In this article, as an initial step for formulating a theoretical basis for patterns, a conceptual model of primitive viewpoints is proposed and, by exploring one of the viewpoints, a conceptual model for stakeholders of a pattern is presented. This is followed by the description of a conceptual model of a process, namely P3, for the production of patterns. The workflows of P3 highlight, as appropriate, the interface of patterns to humans and/or machines. The implications of the Semantic Web and the Social Web towards P3 are briefly discussed.

#!This paper aims to provide a conceptual basis for creating semi-virtual communities that facilitate knowledge creation and sharing that seeks to promote organizational innovativeness. In addition, based on the theoretical discussion, the paper proposes a concrete context that supports and stimulates the conversion of personal knowledge into new innovations and organizational decisions. As a methodological means, scenario driven innovation process is employed as a way to enhance creativity and knowledge convergence within an organization. The authors discuss that in its deepest sense knowledge is the capability to make decisions. Scenarios aim to increase that capability, and are thus a piece of organizational knowledge. The practical implementations of the contexts and the experiences with these implementations are evaluated by two real case studies in real life contexts.

#*Change Management: The Need for a Systems Approach

#index5390c04520f70186a0f55ca9
#!The rate with which change occurs has increased dramatically over the years. At the same time, the change management literature is full of claims about the high failure rate of change implementation programmes in organisations. In this position paper a case is made that change initiatives frequently fail because they are not holistic in nature. The paper argues that change can be managed more effectively if the various interconnected and interacting elements of the system are identified, the divergent interests of the various stakeholders are recognised, and the entire change process is managed systemically. As the failures of change efforts are commonly related to human issues, as opposed to technical factors, involving all stakeholders in the change process is expected to reduce resistance and to create a higher level of psychological commitment among employees towards the proposed change. The paper then looks into the implications that this holistic way of thinking has for information systems development and argues that information systems should not be implemented as a means to solving a problem but instead be treated as a significant tool to help address a complex mix of organisational issues. Information system strategy must be in line with the organizations' corporate strategic plan and information systems must be related to a continually changing organisational context and a turbulent business environment.

#!Mashups allowed a significant advance in the automation of interactions between applications and Web resources. In particular, the combination of web Application Programming Interfaces APIs is seen as a strength, which can meet the complex needs by combining the functionality and data from multiple services within a single Mashup application. Automating the process of building Mashup based mainly on the Semantics Web APIs which facilitate to the developer their selection and matching. In this paper, we introduce reference architecture with six layers representing the main functional blocks for annotating, combining and deploying Web APIs in Cloud environment. We introduce Semantic Annotation for Web Application Description Language SAWADL, an extension of the Web Application Description Language WADL that allows the semantization of the REST Web Service. The proposed architecture uses the Cloud Computing technology as a promising solution to increase the number of public API and therefore making the engineering process of Mashup applications more agile and more flexible.

#!As commonly agreed, Web services fall into two categories depending on their functionality world-altering services and Data-as-a-Service DaaS. Much work has been done on automatic DaaS discovery and composition, such as the query rewriting approach proposed by the database community. In this context, DaaS is described as Parameterized-RDF View over Domain Ontology DO. However, the DO is unable to capture the different perspectives or viewpoints for the same domain knowledge. This limitation raises semantic conflicts between pieces of data exchanged during DaaS composition process. Thus, mediators are typically required to reconcile potential conflicts. In this paper, the authors propose a service-based approach for automatically inserting appropriate mediation services in DaaS compositions to resolve incompatibilities in their data flow. Also, the authors present a context-driven approach to support semantic mediation between composed DaaSs. The implementation and the experimental evaluations performed showed us satisfactory results.

#!Geographic Information GI is currently available at any time, from anywhere on the surface of the earth, for any person connected to internet. Some applications of design, implementation, generation and dissemination of maps on the web are recognized as "Webmapping" application, geographic web services or more generally on demand-map making tools. All these web applications aims the satisfaction of user needs by providing personalized maps in a fast response time with a good quality. However, the complexity and diversity of aspects taking into account have lead researchers to focus on one aspect at the expense of others. Consequently, few works have addressed all these aspects simultaneously. The authors propose in this paper, a Webmapping approach organized into two main tasks: 1 query analysis driven by domain ontology in analyzing a query launched by a user on a web browser and 2 map generation process. The first step allows extracting and formalizing user needs through two map determinants factors: the Level of Detail LoD and Point of View PoV and the second, exploit an hybrid approach "Multi Representation and Generalization" in storing and generating geographical data with integrating Multi-Agent technology in all steps of processing. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, a first tool prototype implementing our approach is so developed using a geographic vector dataset provided by national cartographic agency.

#!This study examines technological, educational/learning, and social affordances associated with the facilitation of team learning during technology-mediated collaborative problem solving. An empirical interpretive research approach using direct observation is used to interpret, evaluate and rate observable manifested behaviors and qualitative content i.e., discussions associated with team learning and team reflexivity. The theory of affordances and social impact theory are integrated to develop a conceptual model that asserts that collaboration mode collocated vs. non-collocated and videoconferencing supported will dictate the quality of information exchange, progressive elaboration of ideas, and the social processes that influence team learning. Team learning is then suggested to give rise to task and social reflexivity behaviors aimed at monitoring and evaluating acquired understanding, adaptation of task strategy, and maintenance of quality intra-team interactions. Results showed that collocated teams did engage in better quality team learning behaviors. Further, persistent reflection on task progress and solution accuracy yielded better team productivity while maintenance of a mutual supportive and positive climate yielded higher perceived quality interpersonal interactions. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications of the study are also discussed.

#!Regardless of the knowledge structure lack about Resource Description Framework RDF data, difficulties, principally, occur in specifying and answering queries. Approximate querying is the solution to find relevant information by getting a set of sub structures e.g. sub graphs matching the query. Approaches based on the structure and others based on semantic, marginalized the common meaning between concepts in its computing. In this paper in order to improve the approximation by introducing the meaning similarity between components in the query and RDF components is proposed, getting better need satisfaction. The meaning similarity measure can be calculated using WordNet and used in all steps of the query answering process. In addition, other important properties in the approximation level calculation between query paths and RDF paths are considered; besides indexing and optimizations strategies are performed. Answers are a set of sub graphs ranked in decreasing order on its matching degree. Experiments are conducted within real RDF dataset.

#!Knowledge Management KM is critical in ensuring process efficiency, outcome effectiveness and improved organizational memory for the modern day business enterprises. Knowledge Sharing KS is fast becoming a rapidly growing area of interest in the domain of knowledge management. The purpose of this paper is to enlist a set of generalized metrics that can be used to evaluate the efficiency and the effectiveness of knowledge sharing in an enterprise network. The metrics proposed in this research are those that can be readily measured by various types of enterprise knowledge sharing systems, and link usage information to organizational outputs. The paper uses an illustrative case example of how an enterprise might make use of the metrics in measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of its knowledge sharing system.

#!Organizational level studies of knowledge management have been hampered by the lack of measures of individual level knowledge management practices and outcomes that can be used as success criteria to determine whether, or to what degree, specific organizational knowledge management practices enhance individual knowledge creation, sharing, and application at the individual level. This paper explores how the knowledge management practices of individuals are related to the task knowledge they use to complete their work processes. The measures presented can be used as one way to evaluate the success of organizational knowledge management practices. Specifically, the paper explores the individual practices of knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application and how these practices are related to the task knowledge conceptual, contextual, and operational knowledge of individuals. A model of the relationships among knowledge management practices and task knowledge components is proposed and tested. Structural equation modeling is used. Results suggest that engaging in knowledge creation enhances an individual's task knowledge through the practices of sharing and applying knowledge. Knowledge sharing and application enhance operational knowledge indirectly through changes in conceptual and contextual knowledge.

#!Access control technology holds a central role in achieving trustworthy management of personally identifiable information in modern information systems. In this article, a privacy-sensitive model that extends Role-Based Access Control RBAC to provide privacy protection through fine-grained and just-in-time access control in Web information systems is proposed. Moreover, easy and effective mapping of corresponding components is recognized as an important factor for succeeding in matching security and privacy objectives. Such a process is proposed to be accomplished by capturing and modeling privacy requirements in the early stages of information system development. Therefore, a methodology for deploying the mechanisms of an access control system conforming to the proposed Privacy Improved Role-Based Access Control PIRBAC model is presented. To illustrate the application of the proposed methodology, an application example in the healthcare domain is described.

#!The convergence of different network types under the same architecture offers the opportunity for low cost multimedia services. The main objective has been the high quality of the provided services. However, considering that older equipment with limited processing capabilities may be present in such environments, a tradeoff between security and service quality is inevitable. Specifically, low resource enabled devices cannot utilize state of the art security mechanisms, such as IPSec tunnels, integrity mechanisms, etc., and they simply employ HTTP Digest authentication. The lack of integrity mechanisms in particular raises many security concerns for the IMS infrastructures. Attacks such as Man in the Middle MitM, spoofing, masquerading, and replay that can be launched in IMS environments, have been pinpointed in bibliography by various researchers. Moreover, an internal attacker may utilize his legitimate security tunnels in order to launch spoofing and identity theft attacks. This paper presents a cross-layer spoofing detection mechanism that protects SIP-based infrastructures from the majority of the aforementioned attacks without requiring an additional cryptographic scheme which would inevitably introduce considerable overheads.

#!An organisation and its work are formed by social structures in the form of relationships. The aim of this paper is to explore the nature of relationships and its impact on learning with a qualitative approach. A case study focusing on the Land Warfare Centre LWC of the Swedish Armed Forces SwAF was conducted. The main target of the study was learning from experiences in training and field action. The analysis shows that relationships are characterised by and contributing to 1 local and oral learning, 2 confusion in the formal design of concepts and processes and 3 issues of power, status and trust. The results of this research support and clarify the viewpoint that the nature of relationships-with various degrees of formality/informality-impacts on learning in an organisation. The relationships are formed and re-formed by their preconditions and may be altered through conscious and unconscious changes of the preconditions.

The authors contend that the ability to properly manage and execute these activities is the quintessential component that oftentimes drives whether projects succeed or fail. The literature shows that IT projects have a dismal success rate but successful projects have been on the rise. The authors attempt to determine if the increase of successful projects correlates to the increase in the number of certified project managers. Empirical evidence is presented that indicates certified project managers do not perform project scope, time, and cost management activities better than project managers without professional certification credentials.

Knowledge Management Systems KMS can prevent knowledge decay and maintain and enhance performance and innovation. This paper investigates if the use of a KMS mitigates employee turnover negative effects on organizational performance. Data on turnover and project performance from two software development teams from the same corporation were collected and compared. One team adopted and uses a KMS to support development, while the other did not implement a KMS. Paired t-tests were performed and confirmed that KMS usage moderate turnover impact on organizational performance. There is also evidence that, when KMS are not used, turnover and performance are correlated with a time lag. From a practical stance, results indicate that knowledge intensive firms can avoid knowledge assets loss by implementing a KMS.

Even though knowledge management practice is demanded in information society, it does not exist as a full-fledged solution in most organizations yet. The reality in IIUM library is that it already employs certain elements of knowledge management through the use of IT to support various activities from administrative jobs to user education. Among the IT support system used include: the staff intranet and email to share and exchange information, library database to capture and store data and the digital library facilities to serve the diverse interest of its numerous customers. These imply that the strategies employed by IIUM library include: intellectual asset management strategy, personal knowledge asset responsibility strategy and mostly customer-focused knowledge strategy.The purpose of this study lies in its concern for whether the elements of knowledge management involved in the administration of IIUM library is achieving the goals of knowledge management and whether the staff and customers of IIUM library are maximizing the benefits of knowledge management in information societies.

#!Intention to knowledge sharing is a growing concern that has been largely discussed in extant literature using Ajzen's theory of planned behavior TPB. However, the studies have mostly neglected the influence of individual psychological needs of knowledge workers on intention to share knowledge. Combining the TPB with McClelland's three psychological needs approach, the study aims at uncovering such influence on intention to knowledge sharing. Survey data collected from 123 Information Technology IT based knowledge workers in Sri Lanka are analyzed using Partial Least Squares PLS method. It was found that attitudes toward knowledge sharing behavior, subjective norms, and need for affiliation are influential in determining knowledge sharing intentions of knowledge workers. Moreover, the findings suggest the need for careful consideration of individual psychological needs of knowledge workers in understanding their intentions toward knowledge sharing.

The authors' research describes the case study of a major IT system implementation project in East Africa. The paper reports on the results of both an online questionnaire and interviews with key participants. The authors' findings suggest that the subsequent failure of this project was in large part attributable to a lack of user involvement in the definition of requirements and implementation of the system. There did not appear to be an organisational culture that recognised the significance of such participation in the project. Although there are issues of definition raised, such as the definition of success and failure, this work supports previous findings that user involvement is a key factor in IT project success and failure.

#!Knowledge strategy is a critical component of knowledge management KM success. Surprisingly, a simple and quantifiable model of KM representation strategy does not seem to exist. This paper applies economics principles to derive a model for thinking of the decision problem in quantitative terms. The decision is about choosing the right codification-personalization split where all knowledge related resources are efficiently allocated to simultaneously support the business process or production. It shows that failing at making a diversified resource choice may conclude a suboptimal strategy split. It seems to justify the propositions of an oft-cited paper and some published evidence. That is, a 50-50 split or a merely pure strategy can also be the optimal strategy. The model can be extended to include subjective decision factor, and be mastered easily. In future research, it may be developed into a game theoretical framework to capture the strategic and/or cooperative KM behaviors.

#!With the advent of Web 2.0 technologies, new applications have emerged that provide Internet users with the power to create content. This study focuses on a specific kind of Web 2.0 application, which is social bookmarking and tagging, and evaluates its educational use within the boundaries of a small Java learning community. Using activity theory, the activity system is defined and the interaction between its components is studied. Furthermore, the findings suggest that such a system could be used as a course tool to create a pool of negotiated and accepted keywords supporting appropriate, effective and efficient retrieval of Java resources.

#!In the study, the matter how the records management systems will adapt to this new process in a rapid way in a period, in which the transformations of public institutions into e-Government has been accelerated, is evaluated with a development that can be a sample especially for the universities. "Modelling of Transition Process of Electronic Records Management and Archiving System in Universities Project e-BEYAS" is a project carried out in Ankara University. Through the "e-Records Management and Archiving System e-BEYAS, which gave its name to the software in which the model is applied, communication within the institution, information/records share inter institutions, and archiving of electronic records can be realized in a reliable medium; integration to the applications on sharing information/records inter institutions on e-Government channels can be provided. For this purpose, system usage scenarios have been created in order to produce, register, preserve, archive, access and report the records and documents safely in an appropriate model for institutional structure in Ankara University. Thus, after completing the workouts, the system will be not only mobile signature m-signature supported with its substructure providing the adaptation to mobile life, but also they can support the e-mail, SMS, integration, audio and video applications that can access the system through smart devices.

#!The management of a territory is a complex process, involving a number of different operators, administrators and decision makers. Territory management requires accessing and processing a wide range of heterogeneous and multi-dimensional GI GI. Within a typical scenario, the process involves departments at public administrations responsible for urban planning, environmental control, infrastructure planning and maintenance. Additionally units such as civil protection, fire brigades also play a vital role when dealing with emergencies. Data to be managed range from alphanumerical information, stored within enterprise-level databases, to satellite imagery, vector data and information coming from on-site sensors. It is acknowledged that creating an infrastructure capable to provide access to such a range of information requires, an integrated system approach, both from a technological and from a procedural point of view. This article illustrates the benefit of adopting a system approach which makes use of Service-Oriented Architectures SOA and 3D geobrowsers to provide an answer to the aforementioned shortcomings. To do so the article presents the client-server platform designed to support decision makers and experts from local or regional administrations in the process of managing their territory. The infrastructure developed allows a large number of concurrent applications to access geographical data in a fully interactive way, within a 3D environment, thus providing support to territorial and environmental management tasks. The work illustrates also the results of the application of the infrastructure within a real-life scenario, thus providing the chance to discuss of implications of adopting such an approach.

#!Theory testing within small-N research designs is problematic. Developments in the philosophy of social science have opened up new methodological possibilities through, among other things, a novel notion of contingent causality that allows for contextualized hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and refinement, and generalization. This article contributes to the literature by providing an example of critical realist one such new development in the philosophy of social science theory development for a small-N comparative case study that includes hypothesis testing. The article begins with the key ontological assumptions of critical realism and its relation to theory and explanation. Then, the article presents an illustrative example of an e-government comparative case study, focusing on the concept of trust, which follows these ontological assumptions. The focus of the example is on the nature and process of theory and hypothesis development, rather than the actual testing that occurred. Essential to developing testable hypotheses is the generation of tightly linked middle-range and case-specific theories that provide propositions that can be tested and refined. The link provides a pathway to feed back the concrete empirical data to the higher level more abstract and generalizable middle-range theories.

#!The Mobile Enterprise is a new form of enterprise in the contemporary mobile era. Although several well-known enterprise architecture frameworks are used by enterprises, it is apparent that there is no industry standard available to enable an enterprise to transform its business processes to incorporate mobile technologies to advantage. This article presents a conceptual Mobile Enterprise Architecture Framework and supporting methodology and process model which can aid enterprise decision makers to evaluate the business values, and analyze the risks and other critical business and technical factors for enterprise mobile initiatives and mobile transitions. The framework covers both the enterprise and mobile enterprise architecture domains that represent the Enterprise, Business, and Mobile Adoption levels. The goal at the Enterprise Level is to obtain a mobile enterprise and the technologies adopted at the Mobile Adoption Level are the different mobile technologies to be incorporated. Each level contains some important components impacting the mobile enterprise transformation. The methodology and process model cover the Strategy, Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Maintenance stages for each mobile initiative, and were validated in a research project against some Ontario Government mobile initiatives.

#!Taking pragmatic, systems engineering approach, this paper identifies a number of fundamental issues that presently arise in risk management, primarily as a result of the overly complex approach conventionally taken in process definition and a lack of coherence within the current risk management vocabulary. The aim of the paper is to enable a fundamental simplification of the risk management process and an improved understanding of the associated terminology. The outcome of this work is a formalised but pragmatic approach to risk management resulting in the development of a conceptual framework and an associated ontology, which emphasises the understanding of people and their environment as part of risk management. The approach has been validated in a number of case studies of varying depth and breadth from the IT domain, defence, rail industry, and education, covering health and safety, business, project and individual needs.

Research has been made in the area of ontology alignment, a grand number of approaches, algorithms, and tools have been developed in recent years, but are still not "perfect" and excellent knowledge. In this article, the author makes an overall view of the state of ontology alignment, including the latest research, comparing many approaches, and analyzing their strengths and drawbacks. The main motivation behind this work is the fact that despite many component matching solutions that have been developed so far, there is no integrated solution that is a clear success, which can be used for ontology mapping in all cases, making knowledge about developed ontology mapping methods and their clear classification needed.

#!The relationship between industrial and scientific knowledge and systems methodologies is discussed in this paper. As the measure of the former on the macro level, Gross Domestic Product GDP is assumed to be the consequence of systems' Research and Development R&D, which is estimated indirectly by the number of articles published in academic journals in the last 40 years. It is assumed that Production, Management and Information Systems IS can be considered suitable main representatives of the quality of organizational processes and that GDP is their consequence. In turn, the Systems Approach SA, Systems Engineering SE, Operational Research OR, Information Systems Development ISD and Simulation represent the methodology set for coping with organizational complex processes. We looked for the articles containing the aforementioned variables as topic keywords in core scientific databases. Results show a sufficient correlation between the number of publications and the GDP.

#!Population ageing is a phenomenon that is quite new and irreversible in the history of mankind. Every country and every organisation is concerned while it is not certain that all the risks and challenges have been clearly identified. Clearly, there is a risk of massive knowledge loss, i.e., "Knowledge Crash", due to massive retirements, but not exclusively for this reason. This risk is not evaluated at the right level, and in this regard, this article, by including the problem of "Knowledge Crash" in the more general framework of "Knowledge Management", enlarges the concepts of knowledge, generation, and knowledge transfer. The author proposes a global approach, starting from a strategic analysis of a knowledge capital and ending in the implementation of socio-technical devices for inter-generational knowledge transfer.

#!A critical problem in robotic manufacturing is that the task of teaching robotics is rather time-consuming. This has become a serious problem in the present age of cost reduction. Collaboration with a company in the field has revealed that the root cause of this problem is that there is not a common knowledge base in this domain, which can serve as shared and reused knowledge. In robotic manufacturing, the skills and experiences of skilled workers are a form of tacit knowledge that is difficult to be acquired and transferred to other workers and robots. This paper proposes a knowledge-based system for sharing and reusing tacit knowledge in the robotic assembly domain. In this system, a modified EBL Explanation-based Learning method is proposed to generalize tacit knowledge from specific robotic programs made by skilled workers. A newly operational criterion is proposed for the generalized tacit knowledge, which demands that it should be expressed understandably by human workers and be reusable by robots to generate programs automatically.

#!The majority of international organizations, especially technologist "fast or first movers" who invest in a new enterprise resource planning systems ERP project are considered Laggards or "late arrivers" by a major software vendor. The majority of the Laggards segment does not purchase ERP software from a vendor without an established track record. Obviously, small or less prestigious vendors have difficulty fulfilling their bottom line without tapping the Laggards market. This paper is a critical and non-empirical review to better understand this complex phenomenon. A case study was conducted within a large public sector university in Australasia during a major ERP-managed project utilizing the Diffusion of Innovations theory integrating it with the concepts of internationalization. The findings confirm that small software vendors have a great challenge to overcome. But the Diffusion of Innovation could be one of many social analysis building blocks for promoting the "Little Vendor" over the "Big Vendor."

#!As an important source for discovering new competitive technological intelligence involved in enterprises, patents can be analyzed to identify the technological strategy and the potential competitors. Based on the patent citation information, the weighted and directed enterprise citation network is established. Based on the modified PageRank algorithm, a novel method is provided to evaluate the technological influence power of enterprises. Experiments with this method have been done using the patent dataset in the field of fluid-pressure and analogous brake systems during the 25-year period from 1975 to 1999 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Compared with the traditional assessment indicator based on the citation count method, the proposed method is more reasonable in identifying the technological influential enterprises, as it gives a comprehensive consideration of the amount of citing enterprises, the influence of citing enterprises and the citation strength between them. This study helps enterprises discover potential technological competitors, which take the lead in the industry.

#!Lifelong learning is often associated with the sociology and the economics of education. However, its broader and more holistic context, which includes learning through involvement in cultural activities, tourism, leisure, and recreation, is much less known. The relationship of this term to the rapidly changing world of Information and Communication Technologies and to various conceptions of interaction is also worthy of further investigation. This article seeks to shed light on that theme by presenting a novel IT platform involving mobile technologies that can enhance access and consumption of cultural heritage community resources. Drawing on material from the ISAAC European project, the article demonstrates how lifelong m-learning can be supported by an integrated e-destination platform that enables the user to build content and engage with that through a variety of applications over time. It concludes with a demonstrator system for the city of Genoa, Italy, to highlight the pathways to change.

#!Enterprise IT projects can end up costing much more than initial estimations, taking much longer time than expected or delivering benefits below expectations. The success or failure of IT projects, however, depends on the project managers. Many reasons are attributed to the success or failure of an IT project. The major stakeholders who are involved in IT projects are the right people to provide these reasons. This study was conducted among IT project managers in the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan area to find out the most important reasons that projects succeed or fail. Washington-Baltimore metropolitan is a major hub of IT activities because of the location of the U.S. Federal Government, several government agencies and the presence of many IT contactors in the area. The study provides metric for comparing reasons for success or failure of IT projects with those projects not located in the area.

#!The ubiquitous availability of wireless networks has opened new possibilities for individuals to learn from each other in open learning spaces like cities. Therefore, the changed learning environment must be understood by e-learning systems and technological facilities must be provided for knowledge sharing and construction. Such systems need to be pedagogically sound, yet adaptive to altered modalities. The teacher who was once the central entity to fulfill the learner's needs may not always be available. Therefore, e-learning systems would fill the gap created by this teacher unavailability by actively participating in learning activities and performing some of the teacher's roles. This article proposes an architecture designed to meet such challenges in a city-wide context. The authors outline the main components and services needed to fulfill the new requirements and provide the learners with tools, services and educational support for learning activities.

#!Many IT projects and software development projects are very complex and sophisticated involving a large coordinated team. Such projects are a constant part of the operations of software companies such as Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, Google, Yahoo, IBM, and others. Many other companies carry large software projects as part of their IT operations. As a result of the size and complexity of such projects, a rolling horizon approach for their planning and management is not only plausible but also desirable. For large projects, traditional project scheduling techniques cannot provide an optimal and timely solution to minimum project duration under precedence and resource constraints. This paper proposes a technique that allows utilizing non-polynomial NP algorithms in a heuristic manner-generating high quality schedules in reasonable time. This approach can be applied efficiently for solving most project scheduling problems. The main advantage of this approach is its ability to dissect the original problem into small sub-problems of a controllable size to which exact techniques can be applied. Thus, it neutralizes the complexity of the applied algorithms and their non-polynomial growth. Moreover, the same technique could be used for implementing a rolling-horizon approach in project planning and management.

#!This paper argues for the need to re-examine approaches to the design of, and research into, learning experiences that incorporate mobile phones in the learning context. Following an overview of 'mobile learning' the author's argument describes two initiatives: Firstly, Design Research is presented as an approach that tends to have interventionist characteristics, and is process-oriented and contributes to theory building. Secondly, describing Augmented Contexts for Development; these place context as a core construct that enables collaborative, location-based, mobile device-mediated problem-solving where learners generate their own 'temporal context for development', and a case study is used to reify this Vygotskian-oriented initiative. This paper revisits Design Research by making use of various questions, and concludes by briefly outlining intentions on how to move toward some preliminary generalized design principles and implications for broader theory.

#!By examining contemporary changes in the mechanisms and practices of representation and communication, this paper focuses on the copy-and-paste affordance fostered by mobile technologies and digital technologies at large. Its widespread use is affecting radically 1 the acceptability standards of incoherent patterns of text production, and 2 the criteria defining successful communication, which coherent cooperation to a mutual understanding is sometimes less relevant than the transformation and reinterpretation of texts according to the sign-maker's interests in participating to multiple communicative networks. In this light, by pinpointing the abilities required and developed in the use of mobile technologies, the paper hypothesizes possible paths for teaching in such a changed semiotic landscape.
