## DIA project

### Part 1 - Data Acquisition and Preparation !

<p> In this part we obtain the research publication datasets. The datasets are in text format.  
As a prerequisite for <strong>Entity Resolution and model trainin</strong> </p>

We have created a dataset following:

> - paper ID, paper title, author names, publication venue, year of publication
> 
> - publications published between 1995 to 2004
> 
> - VLDB and SIGMOD venues.

Using Python, we achived resullts of two CSV fills, which would be used as a future datasets.
